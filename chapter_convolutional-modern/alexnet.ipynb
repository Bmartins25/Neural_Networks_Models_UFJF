        "\n",
        "By comparison, GPUs can consist of thousands of small processing elements (NIVIDA's latest Ampere chips have up to 6912 CUDA cores), often grouped into larger groups (NVIDIA calls them warps).\n",
        "The details differ somewhat between NVIDIA, AMD, ARM and other chip vendors. While each core is relatively weak,\n",
        "running at about 1GHz clock frequency,\n",
        "it is the total number of such cores that makes GPUs orders of magnitude faster than CPUs.\n",
        "For instance, NVIDIA's recent Ampere A100 GPU offers over 300 TFLOPs per chip for specialized 16-bit precision (BFLOAT16) matrix-matrix multiplications, and up to 20 TFLOPs for more general-purpose floating point operations (FP32).\n",
        "At the same time, floating point performance of CPUs rarely exceeds 1 TFLOPs. For instance, Amazon's Graviton 3  reaches 2 TFLOPs peak performance for 16-bit precision operations, a number similar to the GPU performance of Apple's M1 processor.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many reasons why GPUs are much faster than CPUs in terms of FLOPs.\n",
        "First, power consumption tends to grow *quadratically* with clock frequency.\n",
        "Hence, for the power budget of a CPU core that runs four times faster (a typical number),\n",
        "you can use 16 GPU cores at $\\frac{1}{4}$ the speed,\n",
        "which yields $16 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 4$ times the performance.\n",
        "Second, GPU cores are much simpler\n",
        "(in fact, for a long time they were not even *able*\n",
        "to execute general-purpose code),\n",
        "which makes them more energy efficient. For instance, (i) they tend not to support speculative evaluation, (ii) it typically is not possible to program each processing element individually, and (iii) the caches per core tend to be much smaller.\n",
        "Last, many operations in deep learning require high memory bandwidth.\n",
        "Again, GPUs shine here with buses that are at least 10 times as wide as many CPUs.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are also significant differences between AlexNet and LeNet.\n",
        "First, AlexNet is much deeper than the comparatively small LeNet-5.\n",
        "AlexNet consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers,\n",
        "two fully connected hidden layers, and one fully connected output layer.\n",
        "Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid\n",
        "as its activation function. Let's delve into the details below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "In AlexNet's first layer, the convolution window shape is $11\\times11$.\n",
        "Since the images in ImageNet are eight times taller and wider\n",
        "than the MNIST images,\n",
        "objects in ImageNet data tend to occupy more pixels with more visual detail.\n",
        "Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object.\n",
        "The convolution window shape in the second layer\n",
        "is reduced to $5\\times5$, followed by $3\\times3$.\n",
        "In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers,\n",
        "the network adds max-pooling layers\n",
        "with a window shape of $3\\times3$ and a stride of 2.\n",
        "Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the final convolutional layer, there are two huge fully connected layers\n",
        "with 4096 outputs.\n",
        "These layers require nearly 1GB model parameters.\n",
        "Because of the limited memory in early GPUs,\n",
        "the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design,\n",
        "so that each of their two GPUs could be responsible\n",
        "for storing and computing only its half of the model.\n",
        "Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now,\n",
        "so we rarely need to break up models across GPUs these days\n",
        "(our version of the AlexNet model deviates\n",
        "from the original paper in this aspect).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activation Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On the one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function.\n",
        " On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that backpropagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. By contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1 (:numref:`subsec_activation-functions`). Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, meaning that the model cannot be effectively trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Capacity Control and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "AlexNet controls the model complexity of the fully connected layer\n",
        "by dropout (:numref:`sec_dropout`),\n",
        "while LeNet only uses weight decay.\n",
        "To augment the data even further, the training loop of AlexNet\n",
        "added a great deal of image augmentation,\n",
        "such as flipping, clipping, and color changes.\n",
        "This makes the model more robust and the larger sample size effectively reduces overfitting.\n",
        "See :citet:`Buslaev.Iglovikov.Khvedchenya.ea.2020` for an in-depth review of such preprocessing steps.\n"

        "\n",
        "AlexNet's structure bears a striking resemblance to LeNet, with a number of critical improvements, both for accuracy (dropout) and for ease of training (ReLU). What is equally striking is the amount of progress that has been made in terms of deep learning tooling. What was several months of work in 2012 can now be accomplished in a dozen lines of code using any modern framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reviewing the architecture, we see that AlexNet has an Achilles heel when it comes to efficiency: the last two hidden layers require matrices of size $6400 \\times 4096$ and $4096 \\times 4096$, respectively. This corresponds to 164 MB of memory and 81 MFLOPs of computation, both of which are a nontrivial outlay, especially on smaller devices, such as mobile phones. This is one of the reasons why AlexNet has been surpassed by much more effective architectures that we will cover in the following sections. Nonetheless, it is a key step from shallow to deep networks that are used nowadays. Note that even though the number of parameters exceeds by far the amount of training data in our experiments (the last two layers have more than 40 million parameters, trained on a datasets of 60 thousand images), there is hardly any overfitting: training and validation loss are virtually identical throughout training. This is due to the improved regularization, such as dropout, inherent in modern deep network designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it seems that there are only a few more lines in AlexNet's implementation than in LeNet's, it took the academic community many years to embrace this conceptual change and take advantage of its excellent experimental results. This was also due to the lack of efficient computational tools. At the time neither DistBelief :cite:`Dean.Corrado.Monga.ea.2012` nor Caffe :cite:`Jia.Shelhamer.Donahue.ea.2014` existed, and Theano :cite:`Bergstra.Breuleux.Bastien.ea.2010` still lacked many distinguishing features. It was the availability of TensorFlow :cite:`Abadi.Barham.Chen.ea.2016` that dramatically changed the situation.\n",

        "## Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Following up on the discussion above, analyze the computational properties of AlexNet.\n",
        "    1. Compute the memory footprint for convolutions and fully connected layers, respectively. Which one dominates?\n",
        "    1. Calculate the computational cost for the convolutions and the fully connected layers.\n",
        "    1. How does the memory (read and write bandwidth, latency, size) affect computation? Is there any difference in its effects for training and inference?\n",
        "1. You are a chip designer and need to trade off computation and memory bandwidth. For example, a faster chip requires more power and possibly a larger chip area. More memory bandwidth requires more pins and control logic, thus also more area. How do you optimize?\n",
        "1. Why do engineers no longer report performance benchmarks on AlexNet?\n",
        "1. Try increasing the number of epochs when training AlexNet. Compared with LeNet, how do the results differ? Why?\n",
        "1. AlexNet may be too complex for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, in particular due to the low resolution of the initial images.\n",
        "    1. Try simplifying the model to make the training faster, while ensuring that the accuracy does not drop significantly.\n",
        "    1. Design a better model that works directly on $28 \\times 28$ images.\n",
        "1. Modify the batch size, and observe the changes in throughput (images/s), accuracy, and GPU memory.\n",
        "1. Apply dropout and ReLU to LeNet-5. Does it improve? Can you improve things further by preprocessing to take advantage of the invariances inherent in the images?\n",
        "1. Can you make AlexNet overfit? Which feature do you need to remove or change to break training?\n"
